# Self-made-JEE-Rank-Predictor-Algorithm
e JEE Advanced Rank Predictor modelling ,working and discusses how it can help student predict their rank. It predicts both Common and Category (OBC,SC,ST,PWD) rank. In addition,it also predicts the college one may get through the exam either through common rank or category rank. In what other ways rank predictor helps student is also discussed in the paper.Rank predictor uses what type of algorithm is also dealt and how the difficulty level factor changes the entire scenario. The limitation of the rank predictor is stated as well. The rank predictor also helps in searching college to help student know about the opening and closing rank of the college. The objective is twofolded: i) Helps student predict the rank &amp; college and ii) Let them know if they need to prepare themself for other examination or attend counselling for other good colleges. The algorithm which predicts rank and how it ensures the accuracy and precision. Finally, how rank predictor notifies if it encounters any malfunctioning is also mentioned.
